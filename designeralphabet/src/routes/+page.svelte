<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>The Designer's Critical Alphabet is a tool created by Dr. Leslie Ann Noel, an advocate for inclusive and critical design practices. The alphabet consists of a set of cards, each representing a concept or term that encourages designers to think more critically and inclusively about their work. The tool is meant to challenge traditional design thinking by prompting designers to consider aspects such as power dynamics, cultural relevance, and social justice in their creative processes.</p>
<h2>Critical Design Brainstorming Process</h2>
<p><b>Objective:</b></p>
<p>To generate design ideas that are not only innovative but also critically aware, socially responsible, and inclusive by incorporating concepts from the Designer's Critical Alphabet.</p>

<p><b>Materials:</b></p>
<p>Designer’s Critical Alphabet deck (physical cards or a digital version).
Whiteboard, sticky notes, or digital brainstorming tools.
Pens, markers, or digital drawing tools. Timer.
</p>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		<b>Define the Design Challenge</b>
		<p>Begin by clearly defining the design challenge or problem you want to address. This could be anything from developing a new product, service, or campaign, to redesigning a process or system.</p>
		<p>Ensure the challenge is specific enough to focus your brainstorming, but open-ended enough to allow for creativity.</p>
		<p><i>Example:</i> "Design a community space that promotes inclusivity and well-being."</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Select Critical Concepts</b>
		<p>Draw 3-5 cards from the Designer’s Critical Alphabet deck. These cards will represent the critical concepts that must be integrated into the brainstorming process.</p>
		<p>Read and discuss each concept to ensure everyone understands its relevance.</p>
		<p><i>Example:</i> Draw cards for "C" (Colonialism), "R" (Representation), and "E" (Empathy).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Initial Ideation (10-15 minutes)</b>
		<p>Start with an open brainstorming session. Encourage everyone to generate as many ideas as possible, without judgment or filtering. Focus on quantity over quality.</p>
		<p>As you brainstorm, keep the critical concepts in mind, but don’t worry about fully integrating them yet. This step is about getting a broad range of ideas on the table.</p>
		<p><i>Tip:</i> Use sticky notes or a digital tool to capture every idea so they can be easily moved and grouped later.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Concept Integration (15-20 minutes)</b>
		<p>Review the ideas generated during the initial ideation. As a group, discuss how each idea can be refined or expanded to incorporate the critical concepts drawn from the alphabet.</p>
		<p>For each idea, ask:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>How does this idea address or challenge colonialism?</li>
			<li>Does this idea ensure diverse representation?</li>
			<li>How can empathy be central to this design?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Modify, combine, or discard ideas based on how well they align with the critical concepts.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Refinement and Prototyping (20-30 minutes)</b>
		<p>Choose 2-3 ideas that best integrate the critical concepts and have potential to meet the design challenge.</p>
		<p>Spend time refining these ideas, considering feasibility, user experience, and impact. Create rough sketches, wireframes, or storyboards to visualize the concepts.</p>
		<p>Ensure that the critical concepts remain central to the design. Revisit the cards if necessary to check alignment.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Feedback and Iteration (15-20 minutes)</b>
		<p>Share the refined ideas with the group or a broader audience for feedback. Focus on how well the designs incorporate the critical concepts.</p>
		<p>Gather insights on what works well and what could be improved, particularly in terms of inclusivity and social impact.</p>
		<p>Iterate on the designs based on the feedback, making adjustments to better align with the critical concepts.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Final Presentation</b>
		<p>Prepare a final presentation of the refined design concepts, highlighting how the critical concepts from the Designer’s Critical Alphabet have been integrated.</p>
		<p>Discuss the potential impact of the design and any challenges that were encountered during the process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Reflection and Discussion</b>
		<p>Conclude the session with a group reflection on the process. Discuss how the critical concepts influenced the brainstorming and design decisions.</p>
		<p>Consider how these concepts might continue to influence future design work and what was learned about critical design thinking.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>Optional: Documentation</h3>
<p>Document the entire brainstorming process, including the initial ideas, the integration of critical concepts, and the final designs. This documentation can serve as a valuable resource for future projects and as a record of how critical design practices were applied.</p>
<h3>Tips for Success:</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Diverse Perspectives:</b> Ensure that the brainstorming team includes diverse perspectives to enrich the discussion and the design outcomes.</li>
	<li><b>Facilitation:</b> A facilitator can help keep the session focused and ensure that the critical concepts are consistently considered throughout the process.</li>
	<li><b>Flexibility:</b> Be open to where the critical concepts lead the brainstorming. They may take the design in unexpected and innovative directions.</li>
</ul>
<p>This brainstorming process leverages the Designer’s Critical Alphabet to ensure that design solutions are not only creative but also deeply thoughtful and aligned with principles of equity, inclusion, and social justice.</p>
